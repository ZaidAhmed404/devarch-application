The objective is to create a one-page application that displays the details of a service with the following structure:

## Service Details Section:

1.  Service Name
2.  Description
3.  Price
4.  Contact Button
5.  Seller avatar
6.  Seller name

## Subservices List View: Each subservice should display:

1.  Subservice Name
2.  Add Button
Upon clicking the Add Button, a dialog should appear to add a milestone to the subservice. Each milestone will include:

1.  Date
2.  Price
3.  Description
4.  Proof (with three types of proof):
    1.  Location Proof
    2.  Image Proof
    3.  Text Proof
    
After adding a milestone, it should appear below the corresponding subservice.
